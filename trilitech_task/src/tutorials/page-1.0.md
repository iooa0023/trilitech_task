# Pre-requisites

### What tools are we going to use?

Before diving into building our decentralized application, it's essential to have a solid understanding of the tools we'll be using to develop it. As this app is a web application, we'll be utilizing the following tools:

1. [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/): A JavaScript framework that enables us to build performant web applications with ease.

2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A superset of JavaScript that makes our code more reliable and expressive.

3. [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): A CSS preprocessor that enables us to write maintainable and scalable CSS code.

4. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A modern build tool that is used for fast and efficient application bundling.

5. [Taquito](https://tezostaquito.io/): A TypeScript library that provides a better developer experience for interacting with the Tezos blockchain.

6. [Beacon](https://docs.walletbeacon.io/): A wrapper library provided by Taquito to use a Tezos wallet.

Having a good grasp of these tools is crucial to developing a successful decentralized application on Tezos.
